# emdr-lightbar.app

This is a React Native application frontend for the [emdr-lightbar](https://github.com/sarayourfriend/emdr-lightbar) application. While that app works fine on phones it's not really an optimal experience. This repository represents the next iteration on that idea with the introduction of a client mobile application.

This application is currently only slated to present the _client_ side of things, not the therapist side of things. There's just too much going on for the therapist side of things to make it feasible for it to be on a phone screen. The recommendation is to use the therapist settings screen on a regular computer and for the client to download this app (once it's ready) to join the session from their phone (if they prefer to use their phone instead of the computer).

## Development

To run the app in development:

1. Install `yarn`: `npm install -g yarn`
1. Install dependencies: `yarn install`
1. Run expo: `npx expo start`

Et voila, you'll be able to run the application on your phone using the Expo app. Just follow the instructions on the screen to get the app running on your phone.
